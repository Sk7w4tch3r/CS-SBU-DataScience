# Statistical Analysis
This assignment consists of two tasks. In each task, a dataset is given. Use [descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics) and [inferential statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) to write a report about that dataset. For inspiration, some questions are given, but an essential part of this assignment is your posed questions. Apply various yet proper statistical tests and analyses to answer them.



## Task 1: Airbnb
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC.

### Download: 
- [New York City Airbnb Open Data 2019 (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

Also you can download new data from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) which have more columns to work with. 
### Questions
- What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
- What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc) 
- Which hosts are the busiest and why?
- Is there any noticeable difference in traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

## Task 2: Crime Reports 

A bitter truth, crimes do exist. Collecting data about crimes and analyzing them may lead us to their underlying cause. *FBI NIBRS* is a rich database that captures details on each single crime incident.

### Donwload:
From the Louisville government's [website](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-reports) download five consecutive yearly datasets.

### Questions
- Which crimes are most common?
- In which zip codes are crimes more likely to occur?
- Is there a trend of some crimes increasing and others decreasing in number over these five years?
- Which crimes take the longest to report?


****
__You should consider new additional creative questions for both tasks and answer them with proper statistical tests. Each task should have its report and IPython Notebook. Once again, we emphasize the report; it should contain all your questions and your proper statistical answers. Use figures, pictures, and tables. DO NOT PUT ANY CODE IN THE REPORT.__
