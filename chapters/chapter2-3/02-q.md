# Statistical Analysis
This Assignment consists of two tasks. in each task, a dataset is given. use [descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics) and [inferential statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) to write a report about that dataset. for inspiration, some questions are given, but an important part of this assignment is your posed questions. use various and proper statistical tests and analyses to answer them.



## Task 1: Airbnb

### Download:

Also you can download new data from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) which have more columns to work with. 
### Questions

- Which hosts are the busiest and why?
- Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

## Task 2: Crime Reports 

A bitter truth, crimes do exist. Collecting data about crimes and analyzing them may lead us to their underlying cause. FBI NIBRS is a rich database that captures details on each single crime incident

### Donwload:
From [Louisville government website](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-reports) download five yearly consecutive datasets.

### Questions

- In which zip codes is crime more likely to occur?
- Is there a trend of some crimes increasing and other decreasing in number over this five years?
- Which crimes take longest to report?


****
__For both tasks, you should consider new additional creative questions, and answer them with proper statistical tests. each task should have its own report and IPython Notebook. once again we emphasize on the report; it should contain all your questions and your proper statistical answer to them. use figures, pictures, and tables. DO NOT PUT ANY CODE IN THE REPORT.__
