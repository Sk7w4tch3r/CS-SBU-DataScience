# What is Data
<img src="1_1.png" width="500"/>
 
## Data
* __Data__ are a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects. 
* __Datum__ (singular of data) is a single value of a single variable.

## Information
  Data is usually redundant and uncertain, it only becomes __information__ suitable for making decisions once it has been analyzed in some fashion.

## Knowledge 
* __Knowledge__ is the personal understanding based on extensive experience dealing with information on a subject. 

## Wisdom
* __Wisdom__ is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense and insight.

# The age of data 

* Volume of data created worldwide in Zetabyte ($10^{21}$ bytes):

* Data in the 21st Century is like Oil in the 18th Century.
*Like oil, for those who see Dataâ€™s fundamental value and learn to extract and use it there will be huge rewards.

## Data engineering
  A data engineer is responsible for building, testing and maintaining the data architecture. 
### Roles:
* Develop, construct, test and maintain architectures and processing workflows
* Build robust, efficient and reliable data pipelines
* Develop solutions for data acquisition
* Ensure architecture supports business requirements
* Develop dataset processes for data modeling, mining, and production
* Drive the collection of new data and refinement of existing data sources
* Recommend ways to improve data reliability, efficiency, and quality

### Core skills:
* Database systems: 
      * SQL-based systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database
      * NoSQL databases including MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Oracle NoSQL Database   
* Data warehouse software:
      * Cloud-based data warehouse like Amazon Redshift, Panoply, BigQuery and Snowflake 
* Coding abiliy:
      * Python 
      * Scala
      * Java
      * ...
* Big Data tools:
      *  Apache Spark
      * Apache Kafka
      * Apache Hadoop
      * Apache Cassandra

## Data Analyst:
  Guided by business questions, data analysts explore data to extract information for questions posed by businesses. 
### Roles:
* Collecting data basing on a specific request from leaders
* Familiarizing with the parameters of the data set (types of data, how it can be sorted)
* Pre-processing: making sure data is free of errors
* Interpreting data and analyzing ways it solves the business problem
* Drawing conclusions from the analysis
* Visualizing and presenting the findings to the managers
* Determine the meaning of data
* Create data quality dashboards and KPI reports about data
* Document structures and types of business data

### Core skills:
* Statistics (the knowledge of stats makes exploring data easier and helps in avoiding logical errors): 
      * SPSS
      * SAS
      * Matlab
* SQL (to extract data from the data warehouse for analysis) 
* Data visualization tools (to create visual representations of complex data sets to make them easy for others to understand):
      * Tableau 
      * Infogram
      * QuickSight
      * Power BI 

## Data Scientist:
  Data Scientist lean on predictive analytics, machine learning, data conditioning, mathematical modeling, and statistical analysis.
### Roles: 
* Apply quantitative techniques from fields such as statistics, econometrics, optimization, and machine / deep learning toward the solution of important business problems from many areas of the automotive and mobility industry
* Utilize statistical approaches to build predictive models
* Enable evidence-based decision making by extracting insights from structured and unstructured data sets
* Identify new and novel data sources and explore their potential use in developing actionable business insights
* Explore new technologies and analytic solutions for use in quantitative model development
* Design and develop customized interactive reports and dashboards 
* Help maintain and improve existing models

### Core skills:
* Python
* R
* SQL
* Hadoop
* Algebra
* calculus
* Statistics 
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Data visualization tools
* Business acumen
* Communication skills
* ...

# What is Data Science?
* A multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.


* Data Science is the fourth paradigm of science:
    - Empirical Science (Past thousand of years)
    - Theoretical Science (Few past hundred of years)
    - Computational Science (Last fifty years)
    - Data Science (Recent years)
